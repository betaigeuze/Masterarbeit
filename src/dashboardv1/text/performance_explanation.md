This little bar chart shows us how well our Random Forest performs in predicting the individual classes. The F-score is a measurement combining the metrics *precision* and *recall*. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect score of precision and recall and 0 meaning that either precision and/or recall are 0. In this case, it is only an average over the entire forest. So there might be trees in our forest who perform vastly different, depending on which class it is trying to predict. From looking at this graph, we get an idea of how well our model performs throughout the different classes.
