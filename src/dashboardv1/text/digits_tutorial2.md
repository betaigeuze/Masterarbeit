A powerful tool to distinguish these images is a <b>Decision Tree</b>. The idea of a Decision Tree is to look at the different brightness values for the pixels, we call them <i>features</i>, and decide which of them holds the most valuable information. Now, how would you determine that, should not be too important at this point. Let's assume you knew, that <b>pixel_3_4</b> is the most important discerning factor for the decision of which class the flower can be associated with. What you can do now is find a value at which you could seperate all of your flowers into two groups such that you have as many flowers of one type in one of the groups and as many of the other type in the other group. We will call each of these groups a <i>node</i> in the tree.
