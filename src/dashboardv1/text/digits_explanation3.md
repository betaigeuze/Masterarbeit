The bar chart above let's you choose between the 10 different classes. Each cluster of trees has a different **F-score** in predicting each individual class. The F-score is a measurement combining the metrics *precision* and *recall*. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect score of precision and recall and 0 meaning that either precision and/or recall are 0. In the chart, the F-score is an average value of the specific cluster.  
Now you might wonder, how we are suddenly talking about **clusters**. In the background, the dashboard calculated how similar the trees are to each other in shape. If trees are similar enough to each other, they are grouped into clusters. For more information, look up the *DBSCAN* algorithm. Notice how some clusters of trees are better or worse at predicting certain classes. You can switch between different classes, using the dropdown menu.
