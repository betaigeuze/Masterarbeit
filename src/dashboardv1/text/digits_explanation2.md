One of the most common graphs that you will see in the context of Random Forests is the feature importance bar chart. This is an average value of how important each feature is for the classification process. The higher the value, the more important the feature.
Notice, that in this use case we have <b>a lot</b> more features than in the Iris example. What we see here is really just a part of the story, as we see just the top 10 most important features. Scroll down to see all of them.
