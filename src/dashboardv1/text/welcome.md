Welcome to the RandFew Dashboard!
This dashboard is aimed at providing an <b>introduction to Random Forests</b> and give you a deeper understanding of the algorithm.
<br><br>
This <i>streamlit</i> app is structured in 2 pages that you can select, by using the radio buttons on the left. If you are new to <b>Random Forests</b>, or want to refresh your memory, while getting an introduction to the datasets, choose the <b>"Tutorial"</b> page.
<br><br>
After that, you can proceed with the <b>"Dashboard"</b> page, where you can explore the datasets and the <b>Random Forests</b> algorithm in more detail. It is best to start with the <i>Iris</i> dataset and then proceed to the <i>Digits</i> dataset.
<br><br>
The source code for this app is located on <a href="https://github.com/betaigeuze/Masterarbeit">GitHub</a>.  
<br><br>
This is an explorative work, so please feel free to try the different parameters on the left hand side after you have read the explanations.
There is not really a right or wrong way of clustering, since it is by nature unsupervised.
Have fun exploring!
