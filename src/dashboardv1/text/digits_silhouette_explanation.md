These last 2 charts go even more in depth on the idea of clusters. On the left side, you can see a <i>t-SNE-embedding</i> of our trees. You can view this as an image of our forest from above while flying over it. What the t-SNE algorithm does, is assigning each of the trees a x- and y-coordinate, also called <i>components</i> to display them on a 2D plane. The depiction supports our results from the DBSCAN cluster algorithm as there are no considerable patterns to recognize. Try to find the trees from the <i>Silhouette Plot</i> on the right in the scatter plot by highlighting. You will surely have your troubles... If you later proceed to change the parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm, or the t-SNE algorithm you might find clusterings that are slightly better or worse.

Note, that most of the data points in the t-SNE plot have a Silhouette Score of -1. This is exclusively the case for the points classified as <i>noise</i> by the DBSCAN algorithm (which are a lot in this case...). Since this group of noise is not a cluster in the traditional sense, we artificially set their score to -1, as calculating it for these points, would not hold any value. This is because the Silhouette Score is not ideal to be used with an algorithm like DBSCAN that classifies points as noise.
