Before diving into our random forest, here is a short reminder that you are dealing with a Random <b>Forest</b>, that consists of <b>many</b> trees and you should never make the mistake to investigate a single tree in too much detail. It simply has very little implications for the Random Forest as a whole.
The Random Forest we're inspecting was built with 100 trees and a maximum depth of 10 (5, for the <i>Digits</i> use case). To keep it simple, there was no further pruning involved.
