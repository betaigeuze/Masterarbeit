Compared to the <i>Iris</i> example, this plot is a lot less insightful. As discussed above, the cluster assignments are not meaningful at all. Nevertheless, we still see differences in the performances. A graph like this could lead us to think that there is a pattern behind what we see. <i>"Are the trees in cluster 1 actually better in predicting the digit 6, compared to the rest of the forest?"</i>. Well, yes they are, but after all it is perfectly normal that some trees in the forest will always perform better or worse in some cases compared to others. Wether we attribute these differences to cluster boundaries, is a very different question. <br>
This is why we kept this graph in the dashboard, not because it gives you any meaningful insights, but to remind you that you should <b>always</b> question the results of your machine learning algorithms. They will <b>always</b> present you with <b>some</b> kind of result. Wether it is <b>meaningful for the problem at hand, is up to you.</b>
