The result is a different data set for each of the trees. Additionally, while building the tree, instead of calculating which feature to choose, at each node, the tree will pick a random feature out of a random subset of the features. This ensures that each of the trees is built differently. In the end we get a collection of trees, that each have their own data and have a different arrangement of feature nodes, a **Random Forest**.
