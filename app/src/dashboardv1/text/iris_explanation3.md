Each cluster of trees has a different <b>F-score</b> in predicting each individual class. In the chart, the F-score is an average value of the specific cluster.  
Notice how some clusters of trees are better or worse at predicting certain classes. The blue line indicates the Random Forest average for the class. Some of our clusters are better than the model, some are worse.
