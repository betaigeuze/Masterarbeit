Welcome to the RaFoView Dashboard!
This dashboard is aimed at providing an **introduction to Random Forests** and give you a deeper understanding of the algorithm.  

This *streamlit* app is structured in 2 pages that you can select, by using the radio buttons on the left. If you are new to **Random Forests**, or want to refresh your memory, while getting an introduction to the datasets, choose the **"Tutorial"** page.

After that, you can proceed with the **"Dashboard"** page, where you can explore the datasets and the **Random Forests** algorithm in more detail.  

The source code for this app is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/betaigeuze/Masterarbeit).  

This is an explorative work, so please feel free to try the different parameters on the left hand side after you have read the explanations.
There is not really a right or wrong way of clustering, since it is by nature unsupervised.
Have fun exploring!
