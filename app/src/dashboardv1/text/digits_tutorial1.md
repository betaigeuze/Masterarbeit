For this use case, we will use the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html#sklearn.datasets.load_digits"> Digits dataset </a> from scikit-learn. This dataset contains 1797 8x8 images of hand-written digits. Each image is represented as a 64-dimensional vector. For each number, you have brightness values of the 64 Pixels that they are made of. You can see an example image shown below.
Imagine you wanted to distinguish these pictures into which number each picture represents. In machine learning, we call these distinct groups <i>classes</i>.
