Each cluster of trees has a different <b>F-score</b> in predicting each individual class. In the chart, the F-score is an average value of the specific cluster.
Notice how some clusters of trees are better or worse at predicting certain classes. The green line indicates the model average for the class. Some of our clusters are better than the model, some are worse. Depending on your screen size, you might have to scroll to the right, to see all of the classes
