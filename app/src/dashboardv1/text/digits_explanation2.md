One of the most common graphs that you will see about random forests is the feature importance bar chart. This is an average value of how important each feature is for the classification process. The higher the value, the more important the feature.
Notice, that in this use case we have <b>a lot</b> more features than in the Iris example. It is still interesting to look at all of them. If you look at the ones in the bottom, we learn, that there seem to be areas in the image that seem to be completely irrelevant for the classification!  
But let's dive a little deeper into the forest...
